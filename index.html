                The aim of this workshop is to rethink the relationship between humans and computers under
                consideration of human future. The workshop strives to achieve a common platform to increase various
                idea exchanges around the world, resulting evolvement of stronger workforce in order to create a better
                world to live in. In this workshop, we will invite three experts to give their points of view of HEC
                practice on different Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) directions.

                        and computer was, is, and will be by showing examples especially from
                        collaborative work in the physical world.

                    As distant cooperation meets virtual reality, various forms of virtual remote collaboration are available for everyday tasks. Compared to traditional audio/video conference systems, the virtual remote collaboration system has an advantage of providing the additional visual information in real time, which is helpful to collaborators. Some previous work conducted comparative studies between traditional audio/video system and collaborative virtual environment (CVE). They reported that not only general limitations of virtual reality system such as restricted field of view (FOV) and inconvenient manipulation of virtual objects but also specific restrictions of virtual environment in the context of collaboration, such as inconsistent view of shared spaces between collaborators. However, to our knowledge, little work compared conventional audio/video conference system with the off-the-shelf head-mounted devices (HMDs) for collaboration in a holistic approach. In this study, we conducted an experiment of comparing five different devices-mediated collaborations, using only audio, static webcam, movable webcam, HTC Vive, or Microsoft Hololens. I will discuss implications of our findings and provide design guidelines for the use of VR/MR HMD in remote collaboration.
                        <br>
                    In this talk, I will also outline other VR/AR projects, which include (1) the development of mixed reality serious game as therapy for autistic children, (2) virtual realty based tinnitus therapy, and (3) the development and the usability evaluation of multimodal VR serious game to assist people with visual impairments.

                        Kibum Kim is currently an associate professor in <a href="http://ict.hanyang.ac.kr">the Division of Media, Culture, and Design Technology</a> at College of Computing in Hanyang University ERICA. Before joining Hanyang University, he was an assistant professor at the Department of Game and Mobile Engineering at <a href="http://www.kmu.ac.kr/uni/main/main.jsp">Keimyung University</a> from 2016
  
to 2018. Before that, he was a research professor at <a href="https://www.cnue.ac.kr"> Chuncheon National University of Education</a> from 2014 to 2016. He was also an assistant professor at the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at <a href="https://www.kochi-tech.ac.jp"> Kochi University of Technology</a>, Japan from 2012 to 2014. Before moving to Japan, he was an adjunct assistant professor in the School of Computing in <a href="https://www.queensu.ca"> Queen's University</a>, Canada. Before that, he was a senior human interaction research engineer at <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/about/28labs.html"> the Applied Research Center</a> in Motorola Labs located in a Chicago suburb for 4 years. He got his Ph.D. from <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>, Master from <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, and Bachelor's from <a href="https://www.korea.edu">Korea University</a> Seoul, all in Computer Science. For his dissertation work, he studied how small handheld screens could be used for collaborative learning by sharing the visual context in real time between a group of people.
<br>
At Hanyang University, he currently integrates these core research experiences into solutions to overcome the significant challenges blind people face when interacting with Extended Reality (i.e., AR/VR/MR/XR).

                    </h4>
                    <p class="text-justify font-zoom-out"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk will briefly demonstrate an overview of the current research focused on designing user interfaces suitable for older adults to help them engaged with digital devices. The talk discusses three projects (a) development of a computational design approach (ability-based optimization) for improving user interface designs for older people with sensorimotor and cognitive impairments, (b) understanding how older adults learn to use mobile devices, their preferences and barriers, and finding new ways to support them in their preferred learning process, and (c) understanding the technology adoption in the emergent ageing populations in India through analyzing perceived challenges, influences, and motivations, barriers to adoption and issues faced during the adoption stage. The talk will conclude discussing a few senior-centred interface design implications.
